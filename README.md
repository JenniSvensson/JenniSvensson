### Hi there 👋

- 💻 I’m currently working on BoulderLog ([Client rep](https://github.com/JenniSvensson/Boulder-log-client) - [Server rep](https://github.com/JenniSvensson/Boulder-log-server)) a climbing tracker to keep track of boulders I climb and displaying growth stats.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning MongoDB, Graphql, Chart.js and React context
- 🔮✨ Tech or topics I’m planning on learning next: TypeScript, Next.js, Cypress and Jest
